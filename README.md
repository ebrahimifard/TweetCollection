# TweetCollection
This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for different modes of tweet collection:
- Batch tweet collection based on a given query (a set of keywords, hashtags, etc)
- Single tweet collection based on a given query (a set of keywords, hashtags, etc)

*** The difference between the first and the second item is that, in the first one every recorded file contains a set of tweet objects whereas in the second one every file is a tweet object.

- Timeline tweet collection for a given Twitter handle (username)
- Tweet retrieval based a list of tweet ids
- Bot detection for a given set of Twitter handles (This script works based on Botometer).
